I am a researcher at the Experimental Station of INTA Anguil, Argentina, and the coordinator of the National Precision Livestock Program at INTA, with over 18 years of experience in generating technological innovations for the agri-food sector. As a systems engineer and a PhD candidate in precision livestock farming at CQUniversity Australia, I specialize in integrating Federated Learning, IoT, and blockchain into the beef industry, which allows me to approach my field with a comprehensive and cutting-edge perspective.

I lead a multidisciplinary software and hardware development team, which was awarded the prestigious CITA Gold Award in 2018 for developing automatic individual consumption measurement feeders. This accomplishment highlights our dedication to technological excellence and continuous innovation in the livestock sector.

My technical expertise includes:

Designing and deploying IoT solutions in livestock environments.
Implementing blockchain technology for supply chain transparency and traceability.
Utilizing machine learning and Federated Learning models to enhance data security and operational efficiency.
Developing scalable cloud-based solutions to manage and analyze data for precision farming.
I am passionate about driving technology adoption in the livestock sector through open innovation, where public-private collaboration plays a key role in achieving common goals. I firmly believe that fostering cooperation among stakeholders is essential to improving sustainability, animal welfare, and efficiency in livestock production.

With a strong commitment to pushing the boundaries of innovation in precision farming, I am always open to collaboration and knowledge-sharing opportunities. Let's connect and explore how we can work together to take the livestock sector to the next level!
